# Contributing to Shalom's Creative Ecosystem

Thank you for your interest in contributing! This project is built on the belief that human-centered design can be proven through architecture, not just claimed — and contributions that share that vision are welcome.

## Getting Started

1. **Read the philosophy first:** [DESIGN-PHILOSOPHY.md](DESIGN-PHILOSOPHY.md) outlines the four principles that guide every decision.
2. **Understand the architecture:** [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) covers coding standards, file organization, and workflows.
3. **Set up your environment:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/shalomormsby/sage-design-engine.git
cd sage-design-engine
pnpm install
pnpm build
```

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 24+ (see `.nvmrc`)
- pnpm 8.15.0+

## How to Contribute

### Reporting Bugs

- Open an issue on [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/shalomormsby/sage-design-engine/issues)
- Include: steps to reproduce, expected vs actual behavior, browser/OS, and screenshots if applicable
- Check existing issues first to avoid duplicates

### Suggesting Features

- Open a feature request issue describing the use case, not just the solution
- Explain how it aligns with the [design philosophy](DESIGN-PHILOSOPHY.md)

### Submitting Code

1. Fork the repository and create a branch: `type/brief-description` (e.g., `feat/motion-slider`, `fix/button-focus`)
2. Follow the coding standards in [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md)
3. Ensure your changes pass: `pnpm lint && pnpm typecheck && pnpm build`
4. Write a clear commit message following conventional commits:
   ```
   type(scope): description
   ```
   Types: `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `style`, `refactor`, `test`, `chore`
5. Open a pull request against `main`

### Adding Components

If you're adding a new component to `@thesage/ui`, follow the [register-new-component workflow](.agent/workflows/register-new-component.md) exactly. Incomplete registration means the component won't be discoverable.

## Code Standards

- **Accessibility is non-negotiable.** Every component must be keyboard navigable, screen reader compatible, and work with `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce`.
- **Use design system components first.** Don't create one-off solutions when a shared component exists or could be created.
- **CSS variables over hardcoded colors.** All styling must respect the active theme.
- **Motion must respect preferences.** Always use `useMotionPreference()` — intensity 0 must work perfectly.

## Decision Framework

When making choices, follow this priority:

1. **Functional** — It must work
2. **Honest** — It must be true to what it claims
3. **Lovable** — It should delight
4. **Perfect** — Polish comes last
