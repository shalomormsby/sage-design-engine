## What is MCP?

Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an open standard that allows AI assistants to connect to external tools and services. MCP servers provide specialized capabilities like reading Figma designs, accessing databases, querying APIs, or integrating with third-party platforms.

**Key benefits:**
- Extends AI capabilities beyond code generation
- Standardized protocol across different AI tools
- Can connect to design tools, data sources, and services
- Reusable across multiple AI assistants (in theory)

## Platform-Specific Setup

### Claude Code in VS Code

The following instructions are for setting up MCP servers with **Claude Code running in VS Code**.

#### General Setup Process

##### 1. Add MCP Server via CLI

Use the `claude mcp add` command to register an MCP server:

```bash
claude mcp add --transport <type> <server-name> <url>
```

**Transport types:**
- `http` - HTTP-based MCP servers
- `sse` - Server-Sent Events
- `stdio` - Standard I/O (for local processes)

##### 2. Verify Installation

Check that the server is configured:

```bash
claude mcp list
```

This will show all configured MCP servers and their connection status.

##### 3. Restart Claude Code/VS Code

After adding an MCP server, you typically need to restart VS Code completely (not just Claude Code) for the tools to become available.

##### 4. Test Connection

Use the `/mcp` command in Claude Code to check server status and manage connections.

## MCP Servers

The following sections document specific MCP servers and how to set them up across different platforms.

### Figma MCP Server

The Figma MCP Server brings Figma designs directly into your AI coding workflow, allowing AI agents to read design information, tokens, and component details.

#### For Claude Code in VS Code

##### Two Setup Options

1. **Desktop MCP Server** (Recommended) - Runs locally through Figma desktop app, selection-based
2. **Remote MCP Server** - Connects to Figma's hosted endpoint, link-based (requires OAuth)

###### Option 1: Desktop MCP Server (Recommended)

**Why use this:**
- No authentication complexity
- Selection-based (select in Figma, Claude sees it)
- Works offline once files are loaded
- Faster and more reliable

**Prerequisites:**
1. Install Figma desktop app (latest version)
2. Open a Figma Design file
3. Enable Dev Mode (Shift+D)

**Setup Steps:**

1. **Enable Desktop MCP Server in Figma**
   - Open Figma desktop app
   - Open or create a Design file
   - Switch to Dev Mode (Shift+D)
   - In the inspect panel, find "MCP server" section
   - Click "Enable desktop MCP server"
   - Server will run at `http://127.0.0.1:3845/mcp`

2. **Add Server to Claude Code**
   ```bash
   claude mcp add --transport http figma http://127.0.0.1:3845/mcp
   ```

3. **Verify Connection**
   ```bash
   claude mcp list
   ```

   You should see:
   ```
   figma: http://127.0.0.1:3845/mcp (HTTP) - ✓ Connected
   ```

4. **Restart VS Code**
   - Close VS Code completely
   - Reopen VS Code
   - Start a new Claude Code session

5. **Test It**
   - Select a frame or component in Figma (in Dev Mode)
   - In Claude Code, ask: "Can you see the Figma frame that's currently selected?"
   - Claude should be able to read and describe your design

**How to Use:**
- Keep Figma desktop app running with your design file open
- Select components/frames in Figma Dev Mode
- Claude Code will automatically read what you have selected
- Ask Claude to generate code, extract design tokens, or analyze the design

---

###### Option 2: Remote MCP Server (Link-Based)

**Why use this:**
- No desktop app required
- Can access any Figma file via URL
- Works from anywhere

**Known Issues:**
- OAuth authentication can be unreliable
- May show "needs authentication" without clear auth flow
- Tools don't always load after authentication without restart
- As of Dec 2025, this has significant UX issues (Shalom spent a lot of time working in vain to get the Remote MCP server to work, and was blocked at the "needs-auth", despite successfully granting permission via the Figma auth webpage.)

**Setup Steps:**

1. **Add Remote Server**
   ```bash
   claude mcp add --transport http figma https://mcp.figma.com/mcp
   ```

2. **Check Status**
   ```bash
   claude mcp list
   ```

   You'll likely see:
   ```
   figma: https://mcp.figma.com/mcp (HTTP) - ⚠ Needs authentication
   ```

3. **Attempt Authentication**
   - Type `/mcp` in Claude Code
   - Click "Manage MCPs" or "MCP Status"
   - Look for "figma" server
   - Click on the server entry (this may trigger OAuth)
   - Follow browser prompts to authorize

4. **Known Issue: No Clear Auth Button**
   - The UI may not show an "Authenticate" button
   - Clicking on the server name might not trigger OAuth
   - This is a known bug as of Dec 2025

5. **If Authentication Succeeds**
   - Restart VS Code completely
   - Check `claude mcp list` again
   - Should show "✓ Connected"

**Our Experience:**
After multiple attempts, we were unable to get the remote server working reliably. OAuth authentication appeared to be broken in the current version. **We recommend using the Desktop MCP Server instead.**

## Troubleshooting

> **Note:** The troubleshooting guidance below is specific to **Claude Code in VS Code**. Other platforms may have different error messages and solutions.

### Server Shows "Needs Authentication"

**For Desktop Server:**
- Make sure Figma desktop app is running
- Verify "Enable desktop MCP server" is toggled ON in Figma Dev Mode
- Check that the server is accessible: `curl http://127.0.0.1:3845/mcp` should not error

**For Remote Server:**
- This usually indicates OAuth issues
- Try removing and re-adding: `claude mcp remove figma -s local && claude mcp add --transport http figma https://mcp.figma.com/mcp`
- Check GitHub issues: https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues (search for "MCP authentication")

### Tools Not Available After Setup

**Symptoms:**
- MCP server shows "Connected" in `claude mcp list`
- But Claude Code doesn't have access to Figma tools
- Claude can't see selected designs

**Solution:**
1. Restart VS Code completely (not just reload window)
2. Start a fresh Claude Code session
3. This is due to a known bug where tools don't load until restart

**Related Issue:**
- https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/10250
- OAuth authentication succeeds but MCP reconnection fails until restart

### Server Already Exists Error

**Error:**
```
MCP server figma already exists in local config
```

**Solution:**
The server is already configured. Check its status with:
```bash
claude mcp list
```

If you want to reconfigure:
```bash
claude mcp remove figma -s local
claude mcp add --transport http figma <url>
```

### Cannot Create .mcp.json Manually

**Important:**
Do NOT create `.mcp.json` files manually. Always use `claude mcp add` command.

**Why:**
- Manual files may have incorrect format
- MCP servers need proper registration in Claude Code's config
- The CLI handles all necessary setup steps

**If you already created .mcp.json manually:**
1. Delete it: `rm .mcp.json`
2. Use proper CLI command: `claude mcp add ...`

### Desktop Server Not Running

**Symptoms:**
- `claude mcp list` shows connection error
- Tools not available

**Checklist:**
1. Is Figma desktop app running?
2. Do you have a Design file open (not FigJam)?
3. Are you in Dev Mode (Shift+D)?
4. Is "Enable desktop MCP server" toggled ON?
5. Try toggling it OFF and ON again

**Test Server:**
```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:3845/sse
```

Should return something like:
```
event: endpoint
data: /messages?sessionId=...
```

### MCP Commands Not Working

**Error:**
```bash
claude mcp: command not found
```

**Solution:**
Claude Code CLI is not installed or not in PATH. Install/update Claude Code.

### Server Shows Connected But Features Don't Work

**For Figma Desktop Server:**
- Make sure you have something SELECTED in Figma
- The desktop server is selection-based
- Claude can only see what you have selected in Dev Mode

**For Figma Remote Server:**
- You need to provide Figma URLs
- Example: "Can you read this Figma file: https://figma.com/design/..."
- The remote server is link-based

---

## Configuration Files

### Where MCP Config is Stored

**System-wide config:**
- macOS: `~/.claude.json`
- Linux: `~/.claude.json`
- Windows: `%USERPROFILE%\.claude.json`

**Project-specific config:**
- `.mcp.json` in project root (if using project scope)
- NOT recommended to create manually

### Viewing Current Config

```bash
claude mcp get <server-name>
```

Example:
```bash
claude mcp get figma
```

Shows:
- Scope (local vs system)
- Status (connected, needs auth, error)
- Type (http, sse, stdio)
- URL
